  <h1>Hey you! Yes, you!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website; follow me, I’ll give you a quick tour.</p>
    <p>Finally, face to face. Welcome! My name is Ricardo and I’m currently studying IT at the <a href="https://www.internationalhu.com/" target="_blank">Utrecht University of Applied Sciences</a>, specifically Datamanagement & Business Intelligence. I’m based in <a href="https://www.holland.com/global/tourism.htm" target="_blank">The Netherlands</a> and was born on the 11th of August in 1998.</p>
    <p>I have created this website as my first portfolio project, my very own personal portfolio website for showcasing <a href="./projects.html" target="_blank">my work and projects</a> As of now I have an 1 FTE, fulltime, job at the office for a wholesaler in gifts, better known as <a href="https://www.gift-idea.com/" target="_blank">Miko</a></p>
