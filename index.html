    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Ricardo and welcome to my first project, a personal portfolio website. I have created this website as my first project to showcase my future projects. I am currently picking up basic web development to be able to create my first website. Languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript will be used for this. Further down the line I will pick up Python and will also showcase this here, of course.</p>
